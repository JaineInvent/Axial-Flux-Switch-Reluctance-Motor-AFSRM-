- Write a python script that uses/calculates electrical constraints to calculate max torque 
- Generate PCB/ PCB coils using this github repo: https://github.com/atomic14/kicad-coil-plugins.git
- Pretty amazing repo, can use the magnetic feild plots to improve torque
HASL lead free, has a smoother surface than HASL w/lead.
