- A 3D model was created to display conceptual ideas of the AFSRM
- Thermal features were not a result of analysis, PCBs were not optimized yet, and there are no sensors within the case.
  
**What I learned** 
- The bearing holder within the "stator case" is the biggest problem is the bearing.
- Bearing is 7mm thick
- Creating an inner holder for the bearing makes the motor 40mm.
- Without the bearing holders, maximum thickness would be 26mm.
- Thus, the radii to thickness issue can be addressed through bearings

**Next Steps**
- Determine if PCB layering is necessary based on Biot-Savart model/optimization/torque calculator
- Create a way to hold PCB in motor, without reducing coil area for holes.
