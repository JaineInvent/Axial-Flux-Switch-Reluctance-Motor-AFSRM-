## Objective:
-The IMU on the pycubed is no longer in production
-Need to replace with a new IMU
-But the IMU my team found has  **vddio**

## Inertial Measurement Unit(IMU)
-Uses sensors to measure orientation. 
-Most IMUs are **9-axis**
## 9-axis IMUs:
1. Accelerometer(xyz~3)-Translation
2. Gyroscope-Angular velocity
3. Magnetometer-Position rel to Earth's B-feild..this is the coolest one.
